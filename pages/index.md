Hi, I'm Umemiya {@umemiyaxbt}.

I'm not an overly ambitious person, like someone who wants to be a market maker or trader with a 100% winrate. For now my goal is just to be financially free and there's a number that I've calculated to keep me from not being greedy. I kind of forgot it, maybe from Seneca, correct me if I'm wrong.

This website itself will talk a lot about crypto markets, programming, or other random topics, I don't know. Honestly this website is just to [record my progress](/posts), maybe in a few years I want to look back and see how stupid I was. So, this website won't focus on education, but if you can get something out of it, that's great.

Find me on
